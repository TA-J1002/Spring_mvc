This project is built in Spring MVC and acts as an online library. You can upload books to it and enjoy reading your favorite books by downloading them. Currently, I am working on small projects, but in the near future I want to participate in large projects.

A Spring MVC is a Java framework which is used to build web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It implements all the basic features of a core spring framework like Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection.

A Spring MVC provides an elegant solution to use MVC in spring framework by the help of DispatcherServlet. Here, DispatcherServlet is a class that receives the incoming request and maps it to the right resource such as controllers, models, and views.

- Model - A model contains the data of the application. A data can be a single object or a collection of objects.
- Controller - A controller contains the business logic of an application. Here, the @Controller annotation is used to mark the class as the controller.
- View - A view represents the provided information in a particular format. Generally, JSP+JSTL is used to create a view page. Although spring also supports other view technologies such as Apache Velocity, Thymeleaf and FreeMarker.
- Front Controller - In Spring Web MVC, the DispatcherServlet class works as the front controller. It is responsible to manage the flow of the Spring MVC application.

- As displayed in the figure, all the incoming request is intercepted by the DispatcherServlet that works as the front controller.
- The DispatcherServlet gets an entry of handler mapping from the XML file and forwards the request to the controller.
- The controller returns an object of ModelAndView.
- The DispatcherServlet checks the entry of view resolver in the XML file and invokes the specified view component.


The Apache TomcatÂ® software is an open source implementation of the Java
Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket
technologies. The Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and
Java WebSocket specifications are developed under the
[Java Community Process](https://jcp.org/en/introduction/overview).

The Apache Tomcat software is developed in an open and participatory
environment and released under the
[Apache License version 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/). The Apache Tomcat
project is intended to be a collaboration of the best-of-breed developers from
around the world. We invite you to participate in this open development
project. To learn more about getting involved,

Apache Tomcat software powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web
applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations. Some of
these users and their stories are listed on the

## Get It

For every major Tomcat version there is one download page containing
links to the latest binary and source code downloads, but also
links for browsing the download directories and archives:
- [Tomcat 11](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-11.cgi)
- [Tomcat 10](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi)
- [Tomcat 9](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)
- [Tomcat 8](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi)
- [Tomcat 7](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi)

To facilitate choosing the right major Tomcat version one, we have provided a
[version overview page](https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html).

## Apache Tomcat: apache-tomcat-8.5.81 download.
